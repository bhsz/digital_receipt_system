# Digital Receipt System
## Introduction
First Year (1920) C Group Project Extension developed by Zirun Zhai, Ivy Tam, Soon Zhi Ho (Brandon), Wei Yi Tee. \
Designed in mind to eliminate the need of paper receipts.
Our program allows merchants to be able to take and manipulate orders from customers; after an order is paid, the receipt can be issued to the customer via email.
